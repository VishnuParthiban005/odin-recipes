    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish is popular throughout India, with different alterations of the dish in each state. Even in some states, the recipe of this dish 
        changes within different districts. One such example is the state of Tamil Nadu, where a chicken biryani from a town called Dindugal differs vastly
        from that of Ambur, another town in Tamil Nadu.
    </p>
    <p>The recipes differ in taste, ranging from very spicy biryani to biryani that is really sweet, where some biryanis have a mixture of varying spices
        and some biryanis have cashews or dry grapes to make them extra sweet. Although the recipes differ vastly throughout the states, people's love for biryani
        remains the same throughout India.
